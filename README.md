### [JSL05] Submission: Galaxy Playlist Generator



## Objectives: 
To create song playlists based on user preference. This was done by using Javascript programming which manupulates data and dynaically generates HTML content. The aim was also to practice DOM manipulation, to allow real-time updates on the webpage for a dynamic and immersive browsing experience 


## Reflections:

This project was both challenging and rewarding as I had to apply my Javascript fundemental knowledge, such as dynamic HTML generation, CSS styling, and DOM manipulation, to overcome various technical challenges, including dynamically generating menu items and handling user interactions. Collaborating with my classmates allowed me to learn from their knowlege which helped me see and find new ways to code.



## Challenges faced:
The signal was a huge challenge for this project, it interfered with the tie spent on this project. Also applying my Javascript knowledge as it showed me that I need to keep practice to improve. It was a bit challenging for me to display the playlist on the web page. I also had to look out for syntax errors which also added to the failure of the display. Asking for assistance from peers and also debugging assisted me with overcoming the problems.



## Areas for improvent:

Coding a clean code and find better error handling mechanisms.

## Overall learning experience:

Through this project, I practiced using Javascript to change data. I learned how to implement CSS and HTML through Javascript. I also had a fair practice on DOM manipulation..
